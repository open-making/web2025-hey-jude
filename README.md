# WEB2025 Exercise 1 - Take a sad site and make it sadder

## Overview
Practice your CSS skills by creating the most visually offensive design possible.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code:
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
   - Click "Install"
3. Open the project folder in VS Code
4. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
5. Your default browser will open automatically with the project running

## Task

Edit the `style.css` file to make this website as ugly as possible. The HTML structure is already provided - your job is to add CSS that makes it look terrible.

Do whatever! Clashing colors, weird margins, padding, background patterns, copy paste some code you found only, try out a random CSS property you only read about on MDN, create weird hover actions, mix font weights and families. Go ham!

## Files

- `index.html` - The HTML structure (don't modify this)
- `style.css` - Your CSS playground (this is where you work)
- `css-properties.md` - [Reference guide for CSS properties](css-properties.md)
